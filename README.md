# Introduction to data analysis using Pandas

This repository is for the Introductory Workshop on Data Analysis using Pandas for the PyDataBCN 2017 conference.

During the workshop we will use the Jupyter Notebook named [Barcelona_Weather_Analysis.ipynb](Barcelona_Weather_Analysis.ipynb).
We will use this notebook to make a very basic analysis of the evolution of monthly average Temperature and Precipitation values from Barcelona.


### What will we learn
- Reading data using pandas (loading data from a url).
- Basic Indexing and Slicing
- Using DatetimeIndex (Resampling)
- Plotting
- Reorganizing data (MultiIndex)
